# SimpleFlashCards

This is a simple implementation of a flashcard application where users can enter their own study cards and use them here. The words I used in my program are taken from the website: https://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/common-words-100.php and have been translated into Polish. During operation, the application checks which words have been marked by the user as understandable, then subtracts them from the pool of random questions. At any time, the user can stop "playing" while the words that he has not yet learned will be the words from which he will start his new game (this is checked on an ongoing basis). If there is no file with words that the user has not learned yet, the file will be generated during 1 compilation.
